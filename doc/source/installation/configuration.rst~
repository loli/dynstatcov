===========================
Configuration of DynStatCov
===========================
In some places, the source files can be altered to achieve a new configuration.

Changing the data type
----------------------
Locate `dynstatcov.pxd` in the modules source directory. Change the line

.. code-block:: cython

    ctypedef np.npy_float64 DTYPE_t # data type
    
according to your wishes and re-compile. Then re-compile as described under `From source with Cython`_.

Using DynStatCov from C/C++
---------------------------
By default, the module is not public to C/C++. To change this, Locate `dynstatcov.pyx` in the modules source directory. Change the line

.. code-block:: cython

    cdef class Dynstatcov:
    
to

.. code-block:: cython

    cdef public class Dynstatcov:
   
and then re-compile as described under `From source with Cython`_. This will trigger the generation of a header file `.h`, which can be inlcuded from C/C++.
